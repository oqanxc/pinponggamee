## the goal of the project


 * I made a simple 2d game using html css js and canvas.
 * The game can also be compared to a table tennis. The aim of this game against the computer is to pass the ball to the opposite side and score.
 * In this game, which is controlled by using the mouse, it is also aimed to make it difficult if the player score exceeds 4.
